#### Karl Marx: A Summary
> Often hailed as one of the greatest thinkers of the 19th Century, Karl Marx's writing has inspired revolutions and generated centuries worth of fierce political debate. Born in May 1818, Prussia (now Germany), Marx believed that capitalism, which was at its infancy at that time, had serious flaws. He becamed invovled in The Communist League London, the first Marxist political party, who desired to abolish class system and spread wealth equally. He wrote the Communist Manifesto in 1947 with Federick Engels, his benefactor, laying out a Marxist society where wealth is distributed equally.
>
> Marx was actually little known at the time, only after his death did his ideas flourish. Marxism became the inspiration for communism, which became a global movement. However the utopian idea of a fair and equal society did not materialise. Instead, communism tyrannised and improvished it's victims, slaughtering them in tens of millions. Today, capitalism is the main ideology that runs the world.
>
> Marx's criticism were not unfounded upon. Today, the global disparity between the rich and the poor is extremely startling. He was right on his prediction of growing wealth inequality, globalisation, that a handful of firm will dominate most of the market share in the world (Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook etc), as well as boom and bust economics.
>
> Where Marx went wrong was how much he underestimated the ability of capitalism to increase the wealth of everyone through making products much cheaper. Since the 1980s, the number of people living in absolute poverty has fallen by about a billion. He was also wrong on the capacity of capitalism to reform itself through welfare and taxation.
>
> Though the state of today's economy, being dominated by immense inequality and financial crisises is nowhere near triumpth.  Marx's solution was far worse than the problem itself

#### Climate Change: An Economics Perspective
> Just as how climate scientists are experts are analysing climate models, forcasting for future carbon emission and the likely effects on temperature, sea level rise and so forth. They are not at all experts at assessing the impacts of these metrics on scoiety. Just as climate scientists are much better able to answer questions such as "how much warming would the Earth experience over the next fifty years if there is this certain amount of carbon emission" - economists are much better able to answer questions that fall within the realm of "what will the societal and human consequences of 2 to 4 degree celcius of global warming be" than climate scientists.
>
> Economics and economic growth is not a study about money. It is a study about people, resources and decision making. In a rich nation like the United States, increased income may implicate a second bathroom, a fancier car, sending kids to a better university, the opportunity to eat more often in better restaurants, higher levels of security against job loss or poor health. This effect seems relatively frivolous. Very little who live in rich nations have a good concept of what it is like to live in a poor nation. In poorer countries such as South Sudan, increased income may mean having an indoor toilet, clean water, a more put-together shelter and access to medication and healthcare, your own transportation, and the opportunity to work in a comfortable office instead of dealing with back-breaking labour under the sun everyday. The effects are non-frivolous.
>
> Wealth allows people to cope with changes in the environment, such as due to climate change. A very simplified example is, that bad weather causes poorer people to die, but far less so for wealthier people with proper healting or cooling facilites, stronger and more stable shelter, and those who can afford to remain indoors when the wealther is bad. Richer nations have the resources to shield themselves from the natural disasters and symptoms of climate change through building early warning systems, solid shelters and dykes.
>
> Economic growth leads to global warming. Greater access to economic resources requires a lot of energy, and for a poor country to grow that energy needs to be cheap. Let us look into China as an example. In the past 25 years, per capita income in China has increased 5 times. During that same period, energy consumption increased by 3 times. That energy is very dirty: China generates about 5 times as much carbon per unit of income as the US - and the only countries who do worse are Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Mongolia and Uzbekistan. This is caused by the fact that 60% of China's power coming from coal, which is is the last fuel you turn to for reducing carbon emissions. China matched its increasing energy consumption through building a lot of cheap but dirty coal fired electrical generating plants.
>
> This is the conundrum of climate change. China with its power plants, air-conditioned cities, huge dams, subways, high speed trains, modern highways, air conditioned cars, and massive construction capability is vastly better equipped to confront climate change than a poor nation such as Bangladesh. Yet the path to those riches and security net lies through increased global warming. This forces us to ask whether it is better for a country like Bangladesh to accept increased warming and become rich or stay poor in an effort to fight global warming? Or more accurately it is for Bangladeshis to ask that question: why should we – who got rich creating the problem – have any voice in the matter? 
>
> There is a strong anti-climate change anti-growth movement in the rich countries of the world. However that may be, carbon output in rich countries is declining and will surely decline further. This is less likely to be the case in poor countries striving to be rich, as these countries have the most to gain from growth and the most to lose from global warming. It may be, as some people apparently believe, that green energy is actually cheaper than fossil fuels. In that case we have little to worry about: nobody rich or poor, Chinese, Bangladeshi, or Bulgarian is going to spend extra money for power merely to ruin the planet. 
>
> If the poor countries grow as China did by greatly increasing carbon emissions, we have the choice to either respect their decision, or attempt to coerce or bribe them into reducing carbon emissions. The recent controversy between the President of Brazil, Bolsonaro and the President of France, Macron, highlights this issue.
>
> The bottom line is: the best science indicates that if we do nothing the effect of global warming on our children will be modest and despite global warming our descendants will likely be considerably better off than we are. Moreover, the growth effect is so much stronger than the damage effect that this conclusion is robust to substantial errors in either the rate of warming or the level of economic damages.

#### Roe v. Wade
> The United States should no longer consider itself a free country. Today the US Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion. In addition, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has also stated that gay rights and contraception rulings should be 'reconsidered'. America has found a way to become yet more divided, creating risks to the health of some of its most vulnerable citizens, and raising worries about the state of the judiciary. Nancy Pelosi, State of the House, called this a slap in the face for women.
>
> Abortion has already immediately became illegal in 13 states that have trigger laws. And there are no exceptions for pregnancies that arise due to rape or incest. Some states are even doubling down on the cruelty; Missouri tried to pass a law that will prevent women from travelling out of state to get an abortion. Women right now are coming into abortion clinics finding out that they can no longer conduct an abortion.
>
> The reasons that women choose to have an abortion are myriad and personal. But this Supreme Court ruling means that women who need an abortion to protect their health or their lives because of their pregnancy would be unable to get one. Such as in the case of ectopic pregnancies. This law does not mean that abortions will no longer happen, but that there would not be any safe, sanitised, professional avenues for women to engage with them, putting women at higher levels of health risks. Ending row is also very likely to push up America's maternal mortality rates, which were already the highest in the industrialised world. 
>
> The heaviest burden of this law falls on low income women who already have very poor access to health care, including contraception, which makes unintended pregnancies more likely. These women will have to travel further to states where abortions are permitted, which will cost them a lot of money a lot of time. Another averse effects is that this law will push more abortions later into pregnancy, where they become more dangerous, complicated and traumatic. Some women who will fail to have an abortion at all, are likely to be the poorest women in the country who find it most difficult to afford the time and the expense of arranging a long journey to obtain the abortion.
>
> Polls have consistently show that a majority of Americans support abortion rights, so the Supreme Court decision was really out of step with mainstream America. This can be attributed to the decades of commitment from the conservative legal movement, as well as some luck. Including the Federalist Society, building a roster of potential judges and justices who reared on hatred for Roe v Wade, Donald Trump appointing judges who would overturn Roe v Wade, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell steering highly conservative young lawyers into key seats on the bench, and breaking Senate and arguably constitutional norms when he denied Barack Obama, a third Supreme Court pick etc.
>
> A long term strategy the Democratics could adopt is to learn from the Republicans on how to campaign on the court, and how to make judicial appointments a top priority. But as for now, the reality is that Republicans have captured the Supreme Court. It might require a long time for proper change to be enacted.

#### Why People Are Irrational About Politics
> Perhaps the most striking feature of the study of politics is how prone it is to disagreement. Hours of arguments about political topics between people often lead nowhere, and certain political disputes have persisted for decades and multiple generations. This should strike us as odd, as most other fields are not subject to disagreements to such an extent; their disputes are far fewer in number and take place against a backdrop of substantial agreement in fundamental theory; and they tend to be more tentative and more easily resolved. 
> 
> Political irrationality is the greatest social problem humans face. A greater problem than crime, drug addiction, war and poverty. Because it is a problem that prevents other problems from being solved. For instance, before one can address the problems of poverty, one must first have an objective understanding of poverty; what causes it, what reduces it, and what effects various policies can have.

#### The Case for Economic Inequality
> As economic inequality increases throughout the world and the rich become richer, many have the concern that the world is broken.
>
> Economic Inequality is fundamentally complex, and treating it like the pie fallacy whereby - the rich gets richer by taking money from the poor, is an inaccurate and simplistic manner of thinking. The reality is that in a lot of instances, you can create wealth at the same time while taking it from others.
>
> While it is a fact that many people have gotten rich through rent-seeking and playing zero sum games, there is also a significant number of people who get rich through the creation of wealth.
>
> The core cause of inequality comes from a variation in productivity. Most people who become rich in a self-made manner derive their success from being driven. They may be flawed in other ways but laziness is not one of these flaws.
>
> Eliminating variations in wealth would mean sacrifising innovation and productivity. It will also drive people with the desire to become rich out of the country into another space whereby there is a possibility to become rich. Which will definitely in turn affect the economic health of that particular country.
>
> So, as much as inequality suck, it is an inevitable fate of countries that don't choose something that is even worse off. We have seen how the supposed utopian idea of 'equality' has worked out in the couple decades during the 20th century.
>
> "We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both." - Louis Brandeis
>
> You would not want to design your country in the manner that goes against the natural evolution of technology.
>
> It would be beneficial instead to think about how a society with a variation in wealth can function healthily. How would such a society look like? This reframes the public narrative about the need to reduce economic inequality, into being on how we could live with it instead.
>
> I'm sure most the intention of those who are in favour of higher levels of economic equality is to help the poor, instead of hurting the rich. Some may also argue that social mobility comes from economic inequality. Many hopes that by attacking wealth, they will achieve a reduction in poverty. However, poverty and economic inequality are not synonyms. You can very much reduce the wealth of the richest and have it not help those in poverty at all.
>
> If there are people getting rich by tricking consumers, lobbying for tax loopholes and anti-competitive regulations, we should stop them. Not because it is causing economic inequality, but because it is blatant stealing.
>
> The desire to fix the world is noble. But in order to achieve that goal, one has to first understand the world, then focus their efforts on where it will do the most good.

**About Me:** Currently a year 2 Economics undergraduate, my interests are broad and the scope of this blog reflects this eclecticism. While my primordial interest lies in economics and finance, I am equally fascinated by the various fields of social sciences and humanities. In my free time I enjoy immersing myself in artistic endeavours like film appreciation and dance.
