#### On Economic Inequality
> Economic Inequality is fundamentally complex, and treating it like the pie fallacy whereby - the rich gets richer by taking money from the poor, is a naive point of view. The reality is that in a lot of instances, you can create wealth at the same time while taking it from others.
>
> While it is a fact that many people have gotten rich through rent-seeking and playing zero sum games, there is also a significant number of people who get rich through the creation of wealth.
>
> The core cause of inequality comes from a variation in productivity. Most people who become rich in a self-made manner derive their success from being driven. They may be flawed in other ways but laziness is not them.
>
> Eliminating variations in wealth would mean sacrifising innovation and productivity. It will also drive people with the desire to become rich out of the country into another space whereby there is a possibility to become rich. Which will definitely in turn affect the economic health of that particular country.
>
> As much as inequality suck, it is an inevitable fate of countries that don't choose something that is even worse off.
