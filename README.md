#### On Economic Inequality
> Economic Inequality is fundamentally complex, and treating it like the pie fallacy whereby - the rich gets richer by taking money from the poor, is a naive point of view. The reality is that in a lot of instances, you can create wealth at the same time while taking it from others.
>
> While it is a fact that many people have gotten rich through rent-seeking and playing zero sum games, there is also a significant number of people who get rich through the creation of wealth.
>
> The core cause of inequality comes from a variation in productivity. Most people who become rich in a self-made manner derive their success from being driven. They may be flawed in other ways but laziness is not one of these flaws.
>
> Eliminating variations in wealth would mean sacrifising innovation and productivity. It will also drive people with the desire to become rich out of the country into another space whereby there is a possibility to become rich. Which will definitely in turn affect the economic health of that particular country.
>
> So, as much as inequality suck, it is an inevitable fate of countries that don't choose something that is even worse off. We have seen how the supposed uptopian idea of 'equality' has worked out in the couple decades during the 20th century.
>
> "We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both."  - Louis Brandeis
>
> You would not want to design your country in the manner that goes against the natural evolution of technology.
>
> It would be beneficial instead to think about how a society with a variation in wealth can function healthily. How would such a society look like? This reframes the public narrative about the need to reduce economic inequality, into being on how we could live with it instead.
>
> I'm sure most the intention of those who are in favour of higher levels of economic equality is to help the poor, instead of hurting the rich. Some may also argue that social mobility comes from economic inequality. Many hopes that by attacking wealth, they will achieve a reduction in poverty. However, poverty and economic inequality are not synonyms. Someone can be richer than you but that does not mean you are in poverty level.
>
> If there are people getting rich by tricking consumers, lobbying for tax loopholes and anti-competitive regulations, we should stop them. Not because this is causing economic inequality, but because this is blatant stealing.
