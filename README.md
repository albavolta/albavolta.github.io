#### Roe v. Wade
> The United States should no longer consider itself a free country. Today the US Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion. In addition, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has also stated that gay rights and contraception rulings should be 'reconsidered'. America has found a way to become yet more divided, creating risks to the health of some of its most vulnerable citizens, and raising worries about the state of the judiciary. Nancy Pelosi, State of the House, called this a slap in the face for women.
>
> Abortion has already immediately became illegal in 13 states that have trigger laws. And there are no exceptions for pregnancies that arise due to rape or incest. Some states are even doubling down on the cruelty; Missouri tried to pass a law that will prevent women from travelling out of state to get an abortion. Women right now are coming into abortion clinics finding out that they can no longer conduct an abortion.
>
> The reasons that women choose to have an abortion are myriad and personal. But this Supreme Court ruling means that women who need an abortion to protect their health or their lives because of their pregnancy would be unable to get one. Such as in the case of ectopic pregnancies.
>
> The heaviest burden of this law falls on low income women who already have very poor access to health care, including contraception, which makes unintended pregnancies more likely. These women will have to travel further to states where abortions are permitted, which will cost them a lot of money a lot of time. Another averse effects is that this law will push more abortions later into pregnancy, where they become more dangerous, complicated and traumatic. Some women who will fail to have an abortion at all, are likely to be the poorest women in the country who find it most difficult to afford the time and the expense of arranging a long journey to obtain the abortion. This law does not mean that abortions will no longer happen, but that there would not be any safe, sanitised, professional avenues for women to engage with them. Putting women at higher levels of health risks. Ending row is also very likely to push up America's maternal mortality rates, which were already the highest in the industrialised world. 
>
> Polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans support abortion rights, so the Supreme Court decision was really out of step with mainstream America. This is due to decades of commitment from the conservative legal movement, including the Federalist Society, building a roster of potential judges and justices reared on hatred for Roe v Wade.
>
> If abortion really was the issue the GOP had with women, contraception would have reduced it in a safe manner. Yet the very same party so strongly against abortion is trying to defund contraceptives and planned parenthood. Proving once again that what they are trying so hard to do isn't to 'protect life' but to take away the rights of women.
>
> A long term strategy the Democratics could adopt is to learn from the Republicans on how to campaign on the court, and how to make judicial appointments a top priority. But as for now, the reality is that Republicans have captured the Supreme Court. It might require a generation or more to change that.

#### Why People Are Irrational About Politics
> Perhaps the most striking feature of the study of politics is how prone it is to disagreement. Hours of arguments about political topics between people often lead nowhere, and certain political disputes have persisted for decades and multiple generations. This should strike us as odd, as most other fields are not subject to disagreements to such an extent; their disputes are far fewer in number and take place against a backdrop of substantial agreement in fundamental theory; and they tend to be more tentative and more easily resolved. 
> 
> Political irrationality is the greatest social problem humans face. A greater problem than crime, drug addiction, war and poverty. Because it is a problem that prevents other problems from being solved. For instance, before one can address the problems of poverty, one must first have an objective understanding of poverty; what causes it, what reduces it, and what effects various policies can have.

#### On Economic Inequality
> As economic inequality increases throughout the world and the rich become richer, many have the concern that the world is broken.
>
> Economic Inequality is fundamentally complex, and treating it like the pie fallacy whereby - the rich gets richer by taking money from the poor, is an inaccurate and simplistic manner of thinking. The reality is that in a lot of instances, you can create wealth at the same time while taking it from others.
>
> While it is a fact that many people have gotten rich through rent-seeking and playing zero sum games, there is also a significant number of people who get rich through the creation of wealth.
>
> The core cause of inequality comes from a variation in productivity. Most people who become rich in a self-made manner derive their success from being driven. They may be flawed in other ways but laziness is not one of these flaws.
>
> Eliminating variations in wealth would mean sacrifising innovation and productivity. It will also drive people with the desire to become rich out of the country into another space whereby there is a possibility to become rich. Which will definitely in turn affect the economic health of that particular country.
>
> So, as much as inequality suck, it is an inevitable fate of countries that don't choose something that is even worse off. We have seen how the supposed utopian idea of 'equality' has worked out in the couple decades during the 20th century.
>
> "We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both." - Louis Brandeis
>
> You would not want to design your country in the manner that goes against the natural evolution of technology.
>
> It would be beneficial instead to think about how a society with a variation in wealth can function healthily. How would such a society look like? This reframes the public narrative about the need to reduce economic inequality, into being on how we could live with it instead.
>
> I'm sure most the intention of those who are in favour of higher levels of economic equality is to help the poor, instead of hurting the rich. Some may also argue that social mobility comes from economic inequality. Many hopes that by attacking wealth, they will achieve a reduction in poverty. However, poverty and economic inequality are not synonyms. You can very much reduce the wealth of the richest and have it not help those in poverty at all.
>
> If there are people getting rich by tricking consumers, lobbying for tax loopholes and anti-competitive regulations, we should stop them. Not because it is causing economic inequality, but because it is blatant stealing.
>
> The desire to fix the world is noble. But in order to achieve that goal, one has to first understand the world, then focus their efforts on where it will do the most good.

**About Me:** Currently a year 2 Economics undergraduate, my interests are broad and the scope of this blog reflects this eclecticism. While my primordial interest lies in economics and finance, I am equally fascinated by the various fields of social sciences and humanities. In my free time I enjoy immersing myself in artistic endeavours like film appreciation and dance.
