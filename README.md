#### Roe v. Wade
> The United States should no longer consider itself a free country. Today the US Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion. In addition, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has also stated that gay rights and contraception rulings should be 'reconsidered'.
>
> This means that even if a woman gets assaulted, or even if a child somehow gets pregnant, there is the possibility that if they are in one of the states that have made abortion illegal, they would get punished by the law if they get caught performing an abortion. In fact, it has been less than a day since the ruling passed and 13 states have already made abortion illegal. Women right now are coming into abortion clinics finding out that they can no longer exercise their autonomy over their bodies.
>
> I'm certain that this law does not mean that abortions will no longer happen, but that there would not be any safe avenues for women to exert autonomy over their own reproductive organs. Abortions will definitely still happen, but it will happen in unsafe environments, in the dark instead of with trusted professionals in proper santised facilities.
>
> The people of the United States need to come together to not just make social media posts and attend protests, but much more aggressively fight for their rights. In fact I suggest that women in the United States can consider going into an era of total celibacy as a strong act of protest.

>This is clearly a *war waged against women*, don't let them win, it is a fight everyday.

#### Greek Myth of Soulmates
> “Humans were originally created with four arms, four legs and a head with two faces. Fearing their power, Zeus split them into two separate parts, condemning them to spend their lives in search of their other halves.” - Plato

#### Why People Are Irrational About Politics
> Perhaps the most striking feature of the study of politics is how prone it is to disagreement. Hours of arguments about political topics between people often lead nowhere, and certain political disputes have persisted for decades and multiple generations. This should strike us as odd, as most other fields are not subject to disagreements to such an extent; their disputes are far fewer in number and take place against a backdrop of substantial agreement in fundamental theory; and they tend to be more tentative and more easily resolved. 
> 
> Political irrationality is the greatest social problem humans face. A greater problem than crime, drug addiction, war and poverty. Because it is a problem that prevents other problems from being solved. For instance, before one can address the problems of poverty, one must first have an objective understanding of poverty; what causes it, what reduces it, and what effects various policies can have.

#### On Economic Inequality
> As economic inequality increases throughout the world and the rich become richer, many have the concern that the world is broken.
>
> Economic Inequality is fundamentally complex, and treating it like the pie fallacy whereby - the rich gets richer by taking money from the poor, is an inaccurate and simplistic manner of thinking. The reality is that in a lot of instances, you can create wealth at the same time while taking it from others.
>
> While it is a fact that many people have gotten rich through rent-seeking and playing zero sum games, there is also a significant number of people who get rich through the creation of wealth.
>
> The core cause of inequality comes from a variation in productivity. Most people who become rich in a self-made manner derive their success from being driven. They may be flawed in other ways but laziness is not one of these flaws.
>
> Eliminating variations in wealth would mean sacrifising innovation and productivity. It will also drive people with the desire to become rich out of the country into another space whereby there is a possibility to become rich. Which will definitely in turn affect the economic health of that particular country.
>
> So, as much as inequality suck, it is an inevitable fate of countries that don't choose something that is even worse off. We have seen how the supposed utopian idea of 'equality' has worked out in the couple decades during the 20th century.
>
> "We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both." - Louis Brandeis
>
> You would not want to design your country in the manner that goes against the natural evolution of technology.
>
> It would be beneficial instead to think about how a society with a variation in wealth can function healthily. How would such a society look like? This reframes the public narrative about the need to reduce economic inequality, into being on how we could live with it instead.
>
> I'm sure most the intention of those who are in favour of higher levels of economic equality is to help the poor, instead of hurting the rich. Some may also argue that social mobility comes from economic inequality. Many hopes that by attacking wealth, they will achieve a reduction in poverty. However, poverty and economic inequality are not synonyms. You can very much reduce the wealth of the richest and have it not help those in poverty at all.
>
> If there are people getting rich by tricking consumers, lobbying for tax loopholes and anti-competitive regulations, we should stop them. Not because it is causing economic inequality, but because it is blatant stealing.
>
> The desire to fix the world is noble. But in order to achieve that goal, one has to first understand the world, then focus their efforts on where it will do the most good.

**About Me:** Currently a year 2 Economics undergraduate, my interests are broad and the scope of this blog reflects this eclecticism. While my primordial interest lies in economics and finance, I am equally fascinated by the various fields of social sciences and humanities. In my free time I enjoy immersing myself in artistic endeavours like film appreciation and dance.
